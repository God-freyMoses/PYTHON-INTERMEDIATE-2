# FNB App Academy – Week 9 Python Project

Welcome to the final project of the FNB App Academy! 🎉  
This repository showcases my journey through Python fundamentals, demonstrating key programming concepts and practical problem-solving skills.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a collection of Python scripts that cover essential programming topics, including:

- **Functions and Recursion**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Working with Lists and Dictionaries**
- **Custom and Built-in Modules**
- **Math Operations**
- **File and Directory Structure**
- **User Input and Output**

Each script is designed to reinforce a specific concept, culminating in a mini-app for rectangle calculations.

## 📝 Highlights

- **[functions.py](functions.py):**  
  Defines and demonstrates functions, including recursion with a factorial example.

- **[exception_handling.py](exception_handling.py):**  
  Shows how to handle errors gracefully using try/except/finally blocks.

- **[math_operations.py](math_operations.py) & [modules.py](modules.py):**  
  Illustrates creating and importing custom modules for basic math operations.

- **[modules_buitin.py](modules_buitin.py):**  
  Explores Python's built-in modules like `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, and `sys`.

- **[rectangle_calc.py](rectangle_calc.py/):**  
  A mini-app that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input.

## 🏗️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files.
2. Run any script using Python 3:
   ```sh
   python filename.py
   ```
   For example, to use the rectangle calculator:
   ```sh
   cd rectangle_calc.py
   python rectangle.py
   ```

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Writing and using functions (including recursion)
- Handling exceptions and errors
- Organizing code with modules and packages
- Using built-in Python modules
- Accepting user input and displaying output
- Structuring a Python project
